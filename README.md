# Rust Lang Book - My Notes

This is my notes from reading the Rust Lang Book. I'm using this as a way to learn Rust and to keep track of my progress. Hope you find it useful!

Each chapter will have its own folder. The folder will contain a `README.md` file with my notes and a `src` folder with the code examples from the chapter.
