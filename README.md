# Rust Lang Book - My Notes

Welcome to my notes from reading the Rust Lang Book! I'm using this as a way to learn Rust and to keep track of my progress. Below, you'll find organized chapters, each with its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` file with my notes and a Cargo project with the associated project files.

## Running the Code

To run the code examples for each chapter, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the chapter's folder:

   ```bash
   cd 02-guessing-game
   ```

2. Enter the Cargo project folder:

   ```bash
   cd game
   ```

3. Run the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

Feel free to explore the chapters and code to enhance your understanding of Rust!
