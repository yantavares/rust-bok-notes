# Chapter 7 - Managing Packages, Crates and Modules

- When you add a file to a project, it becomes a module.
- When you add a directory to a project, it becomes a crate.
- The structure of a project can be represented as a tree.
- The root of the tree is the crate.
- The branches of the tree are the modules.
- The leaves of the tree are the functions.
- The trunk of the tree is the main function.
- You can see all the modules in a crate by running `cargo tree`.
- You can see all the functions in a module by running `cargo doc --open`.
- All information about a crate is stored in a file called `Cargo.toml`.
- Package is a collection of crates.
- A package must have at least one crate.
- To create a new library crate, run `cargo new --lib <crate_name>`.
- To create a new binary crate, run `cargo new --bin <crate_name>`.
- Modules are specified using the `mod` keyword.
- Modules can be nested.
- Modules can be public or private.
- Modules can be accessed using the `use` keyword.
- inside a module, basically everything is default private.
- To make something public, use the `pub` keyword.
- Although enums and structs are public by default, they are private inside modules.
- In rust, when importing functions, it is best practice to import the parent module.
- e.g. `use std::io::stdin` is better than `use std::io::stdin::read_line`.
