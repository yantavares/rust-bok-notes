# Chapter 20: Creating a Multithreaded Web Server in Rust

## Overview

This chapter guides you through the process of creating a basic, multithreaded web server using Rust. The server is designed to listen on `127.0.0.1:7878` and automatically shuts down after processing 2 requests, serving as a demonstration of Rust's capabilities in network programming.

## Running the Server

To start the server, navigate to the server directory and execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd server
cargo run
```

## Key Concepts

### TCP Connections

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A fundamental protocol in the internet protocol suite. TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of bytes between applications communicating over an IP network.
- **Application**: TCP is crucial for applications requiring dependable data exchange, like web servers, where it manages the connections between the server and its clients.

### Implementing a Multithreaded Server

- **`std::net` Module**: Used to create a TCP listener that waits for incoming connection attempts. Once a connection is established, the server can communicate with the client.
- **`std::thread` Module**: Enables the creation of new threads, allowing the server to handle each connection in a separate thread. This is key to achieving concurrency, as it allows the server to process multiple requests simultaneously.
- **`std::fs` Module**: Facilitates reading files from the file system. This is used to serve requested files to the client.

### Advantages of Multithreading

- **Performance and Scalability**: By handling each client request in a separate thread, the server can process multiple requests at the same time, significantly improving its throughput and responsiveness.
- **Isolation**: Threads operate in separate execution environments, reducing the risk that an issue in one request handler will directly impact another.

### Project Structure

- **`main.rs` in `bin` Directory**: Contains the entry point for the server application. This separation allows for better organization, especially in projects where the server might be only one component of a larger application.
- **`lib.rs` in `src` Directory**: Houses the server's logic, abstracting the details of handling TCP connections and threading away from the main function. This modular approach facilitates testing and maintenance.
