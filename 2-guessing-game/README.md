# Chapter 2 - Guessing Game

## Notes

- Variables are immutable by default
- `let` is used to create a variable
- `mut` is used to make a variable mutable
- `String::new()` is used to create a new empty string
- `io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)` is used to read a line from the standard input
- `&` is used to indicate that the argument is a reference
- read_line returns a Result type, which is an enum with variants Ok and Err
